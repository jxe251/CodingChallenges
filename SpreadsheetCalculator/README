Qantcast Spreadsheet Calculator coding challenge

by Kevin Cheng, Nov 2012

compiled with: g++ (GCC) 4.7.2 20120921 (Red Hat 4.7.2-2)

Build using:
    make


Notes:
    Made with the general assumption of properly formatted inputs, although
the majority of bad inputs should be gracefully handled.

    This version supports negative numbers, but it does not support the
increment/decrement operators. I would need clarification as to whether
or not to re-invoke the increment/decrement during recursive evaluations.
